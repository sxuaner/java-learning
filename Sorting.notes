# When to implement comparable and when to implement Comparator
Both are interfaces. 
1.Comparable.compareTo(anotherObject)
2.Comparator.compare(a,b)

From the method names, we can see Comparable is used by the object being compared itself and Comparator is used by
3rd party, such as an array who is comparing its elements
