# Definition
In computing, serialization (US spelling) or serialisation (UK spelling) is the process of translating a data 
structure or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory data buffer) or 
transmitted (for example, over a computer network) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer 
environment)
