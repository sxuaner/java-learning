    int readâ€‹(CharBuffer cb) throws IOException
    Attempts to read characters into the specified character buffer. The buffer is used as a repository 
    of characters as-is: the only changes made are the results of a put operation. No flipping or rewinding of the buffer is performed.
    
    Parameters:
    cb - the buffer to read characters into
    
    Returns:
    The number of char values added to the buffer, or -1 if this source of characters is at its end
    
    Throws:
    IOException - if an I/O error occurs
    NullPointerException - if cb is null
    ReadOnlyBufferException - if cb is a read only buffer
