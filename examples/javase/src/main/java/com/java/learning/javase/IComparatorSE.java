import java.util.Comparator;

/**
 * 
 * A comparison function, which imposes a total ordering on some collection of
 * objects. Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such as Collections.sort
 * or Arrays.sort) to allow precise control over the sort order. Comparators can
 * also be used to control the order of certain data structures (such as sorted
 * sets or sorted maps), or to provide an ordering for collections of objects
 * that don't have a natural ordering. The ordering imposed by a comparator c on
 * a set of elements S is said to be consistent with equals if and only if
 * c.compare(e1, e2)==0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every e1
 * and e2 in S.
 * 
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit comparator c is used
 * with elements (or keys) drawn from a set S. If the ordering imposed by c on S
 * is inconsistent with equals, the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave
 * "strangely." In particular the sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the
 * general contract for set (or map), which is defined in terms of equals.
 * 
 * For example, suppose one adds two elements a and b such that (a.equals(b) &&
 * c.compare(a, b) != 0) to an empty TreeSet with comparator c. The second add
 * operation will return true (and the size of the tree set will increase)
 * because a and b are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even
 * though this is contrary to the specification of the Set.add method.
 * 
 * Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to also implement
 * java.io.Serializable, as they may be used as ordering methods in serializable
 * data structures (like TreeSet, TreeMap). In order for the data structure to
 * serialize successfully, the comparator (if provided) must implement
 * Serializable.
 * 
 * For the mathematically inclined, the relation that defines the imposed
 * ordering that a given comparator c imposes on a given set of objects S is:
 * 
 * {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) <= 0}.
 * 
 * The quotient for this total order is: {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) ==
 * 0}.
 * 
 * It follows immediately from the contract for compare that the quotient is an
 * equivalence relation on S, and that the imposed ordering is a total order on
 * S. When we say that the ordering imposed by c on S is consistent with equals,
 * we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence relation
 * defined by the objects' equals(Object) method(s): {(x, y) such that
 * x.equals(y)}. Unlike Comparable, a comparator may optionally permit
 * comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for an
 * equivalence relation.
 * 
 * This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
