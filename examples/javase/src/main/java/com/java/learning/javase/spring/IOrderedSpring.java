/**
public interface Ordered

Ordered is an interface that can be implemented by objects that should be orderable, for example in a Collection.
The actual order can be interpreted as prioritization, with the first object (with the lowest order value) having the highest priority.

Note that there is also a priority marker for this interface: PriorityOrdered. Consult the Javadoc for PriorityOrdered for details on how 
PriorityOrdered objects are ordered relative to plain Ordered objects.

Consult the Javadoc for OrderComparator for details on the sort semantics for non-ordered objects.
