/**
 * public interface CharSequence
 * 
 * A CharSequence is a readable sequence of char values. This interface provides
 * uniform, read-only access to many different kinds of char sequences. A char
 * value represents a character in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) or a
 * surrogate. Refer to Unicode Character Representation for details. This
 * interface does not refine the general contracts of the equals and hashCode
 * methods. The result of testing two objects that implement CharSequence for
 * equality is therefore, in general, undefined. Each object may be implemented
 * by a different class, and there is no guarantee that each class will be
 * capable of testing its instances for equality with those of the other. It is
 * therefore inappropriate to use arbitrary CharSequence instances as elements
 * in a set or as keys in a map.
