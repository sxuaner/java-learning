/**
 * Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an
 * executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate
 * internal properties of the program. For example, it's possible for a Java
 * class to obtain the names of all its members and display them.
 * 
 * Java reflection is useful because it supports dynamic retrieval of
 * information about classes and data structures by name, and allows for their
 * manipulation within an executing Java program
 * 
 * ? How to retrieve info about classes at runtime
