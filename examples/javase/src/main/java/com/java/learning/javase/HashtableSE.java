 * As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to implement the
 * Map interface, making it a member of the Java Collections Framework. Unlike
 * the new collection implementations, Hashtable is synchronized. If a
 * thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use HashMap in
 * place of Hashtable. If a thread-safe highly-concurrent implementation is
 * desired, then it is recommended to use ConcurrentHashMap in place of
 * Hashtable
