/* 
Iterating over a collection is uglier than it needs to be. Consider the following method, which takes 
a collection of timer tasks and cancels them:

void cancelAll(Collection<TimerTask> c) {
    for (Iterator<TimerTask> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
        i.next().cancel();
}

The iterator is just clutter. Furthermore, it is an opportunity for error. The iterator variable occurs 
three times in each loop: that is two chances to get it wrong. The for-each construct gets rid of the 
clutter and the opportunity for error. Here is how the example looks with the for-each construct:

void cancelAll(Collection<TimerTask> c) {
    for (TimerTask t : c)
        t.cancel();
} */
