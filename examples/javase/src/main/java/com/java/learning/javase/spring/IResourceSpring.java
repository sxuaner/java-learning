        Interface for a resource descriptor that abstracts from the actual type of underlying resource, such as a file or class path resource.

        An InputStream can be opened for every resource if it exists in physical form, but a URL or File handle can just be returned for certain
        resources. The actual behavior is implementation-specific.
