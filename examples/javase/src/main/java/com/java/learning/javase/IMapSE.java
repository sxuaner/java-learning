/**
 * public interface Map<K,â€‹V> 
 * 
 An object that maps keys to values. A map cannot
 * contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value. This interface
 * takes the place of the Dictionary class, which was a totally abstract class
 * rather than an interface.
 * 
 * The Map interface provides three collection views, which allow a map's
 * contents to be viewed as a set of keys, collection of values, or set of
 * key-value mappings. 
 * 
 * The order of a map is defined as the order in which the iterators on the map's collection views return their elements. Some map
 * implementations, like the TreeMap class, make specific guarantees as to their order; others, like the HashMap class, do not.
 * 
 * Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys.
 * The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is changed
 * in a manner that affects equals comparisons while the object is a key in the
 * map. A special case of this prohibition is that it is not permissible for a
 * map to contain itself as a key. While it is permissible for a map to contain
 * itself as a value, extreme caution is advised: the equals and hashCode
 * methods are no longer well defined on such a map.
 * 
 * All general-purpose map implementation classes should provide two "standard"
 * constructors: a void (no arguments) constructor which creates an empty map,
 * and a constructor with a single argument of type Map, which creates a new map
 * with the same key-value mappings as its argument. In effect, the latter
 * constructor allows the user to copy any map, producing an equivalent map of
 * the desired class. There is no way to enforce this recommendation (as
 * interfaces cannot contain constructors) but all of the general-purpose map
 * implementations in the JDK comply.
 * 
 * The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the methods
 * that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw
 * UnsupportedOperationException if this map does not support the operation. If
 * this is the case, these methods may, but are not required to, throw an
 * UnsupportedOperationException if the invocation would have no effect on the
 * map. For example, invoking the putAll(Map) method on an unmodifiable map may,
 * but is not required to, throw the exception if the map whose mappings are to
 * be "superimposed" is empty.
 * 
 * Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they may
 * contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and values, and
 * some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting to insert an
 * ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Attempting to query the presence
 * of an ineligible key or value may throw an exception, or it may simply return
 * false; some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will
 * exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible
 * key or value whose completion would not result in the insertion of an
 * ineligible element into the map may throw an exception or it may succeed, at
 * the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in
 * the specification for this interface.
 * 
 * Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in terms of the
 * equals method. For example, the specification for the containsKey(Object key)
 * method says: "returns true if and only if this map contains a mapping for a
 * key k such that (key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))." This specification
 * should not be construed to imply that invoking Map.containsKey with a
 * non-null argument key will cause key.equals(k) to be invoked for any key k.
 * Implementations are free to implement optimizations whereby the equals
 * invocation is avoided, for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the
 * two keys. (
 * 
 * The Object.hashCode() specification guarantees that two objects with unequal hash codes cannot be equal. 
 * 
 * More generally, implementations of the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
 * the specified behavior of underlying Object methods wherever the implementor
 * deems it appropriate.
 * 
 * Some map operations which perform recursive traversal of the map may fail
 * with an exception for self-referential instances where the map directly or
 * indirectly contains itself. This includes the clone(), equals(), hashCode()
 * and toString() methods. Implementations may optionally handle the
 * self-referential scenario, however most current implementations do not do so.
 * 
 * Unmodifiable Maps
 * 
 * The Map.of, Map.ofEntries, and Map.copyOf static factory methods provide a
 * convenient way to create unmodifiable maps. The Map instances created by
 * these methods have the following characteristics:
 * 
 * They are unmodifiable. Keys and values cannot be added, removed, or updated.
 * Calling any mutator method on the Map will always cause
 * UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown. However, if the contained keys or
 * values are themselves mutable, this may cause the Map to behave
 * inconsistently or its contents to appear to change. They disallow null keys
 * and values. Attempts to create them with null keys or values result in
 * NullPointerException. They are serializable if all keys and values are
 * serializable. They reject duplicate keys at creation time. Duplicate keys
 * passed to a static factory method result in IllegalArgumentException. The
 * iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change. They are
 * value-based. Callers should make no assumptions about the identity of the
 * returned instances. Factories are free to create new instances or reuse
 * existing ones. Therefore, identity-sensitive operations on these instances
 * (reference equality (==), identity hash code, and synchronization) are
 * unreliable and should be avoided. They are serialized as specified on the
 * Serialized Form page. 
 * 
 * This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.
